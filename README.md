# Miniphlow
PHP implementation of miniflow from Udacity CarND

# Achievments
 - understand miniflow (forwardprop, backprop, topological sort)
 - get familiar to `eclipse che` :-)
 - find php limitations when used for NNs

# Components
 ** Dataset
  A csv file containing Boston housing data from here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/housing
  A loading class

 ** Nodes
  Nodes for the neural network: input, weight, bias, linear, sigmoidal, mean squared error

 ** Numphy
  A php math library, replication of some parts from Numpy. Not optimized for performance, only to implement the required functions for the current project.
